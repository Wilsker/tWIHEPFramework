#  CaseA   Yes      Yes     Jet_pt: you want to save it and need also to read it (using SetBranchStatus+CopyEntries would require more processing time) 
#  CaseB   Yes      No      Jet_muonEnergyFraction: you want to read it to define jet ID, but may not want to save it  
#  CaseC   No       Yes     Jet_LooseID: you can not read it from ntuplas if there is not, but you want to save in rootplas
